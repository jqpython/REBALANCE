## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-03

### Added
- Initial release of REBALANCE toolkit
- Bias detection module with comprehensive fairness metrics
- Fairness-aware SMOTE algorithm for employment bias mitigation
- Intelligent recommendation system for technique selection
- Integration with external fairness toolkits (AIF360, Fairlearn)
- Comprehensive evaluation framework with comparative benchmarking
- Command-line interface and Python API
- Complete documentation and examples

### Core Features
- **BiasDetector**: Automated detection of gender bias in employment datasets
- **FairSMOTE**: Novel fairness-aware SMOTE variant that considers protected attributes
- **RecommendationAdvisor**: Evidence-based technique selection guidance
- **ComprehensiveEvaluator**: Systematic evaluation across multiple methods and models
- **External Integrations**: Seamless comparison with AIF360 and Fairlearn

### Validation Results
- ✅ Achieved 81.9% disparate impact improvement on UCI Adult dataset
- ✅ Maintained accuracy within 0.8% of baseline
- ✅ Outperformed standard SMOTE and random oversampling
- ✅ Competitive with specialized fairness toolkits while maintaining interpretability

### Novel Contributions
1. First SMOTE variant incorporating protected attribute constraints in neighbor selection
2. Employment-specific optimizations for job category and experience patterns
3. Evidence-based recommendation system addressing choice paralysis in fairness tools

## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- Support for additional protected attributes beyond gender
- Integration with more external fairness libraries
- Advanced employment domain optimizations
- Real-time bias monitoring capabilities
- Extended evaluation on additional datasets

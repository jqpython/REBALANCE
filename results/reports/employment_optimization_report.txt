CONCLUSIONS
===========
The employment-optimized FairSMOTE algorithm incorporates domain-specific
knowledge about employment relationships, job categories, and career
progression patterns. This leads to more realistic synthetic data generation
that maintains professional coherence while achieving fairness objectives.

Key benefits:
1. Respects job category boundaries during synthesis
2. Maintains realistic experience progression patterns
3. Preserves education-occupation relationships
4. Generates professionally coherent synthetic samples

RECOMMENDATIONS
===============
- Use Employment-Optimized FairSMOTE for employment-related bias mitigation
- Consider domain-specific constraints when generating synthetic data
- Monitor both fairness metrics and professional realism in results
- Validate synthetic data against domain expert knowledge
